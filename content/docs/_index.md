## Creating new site pages

For this guide we'll work through a single example: creating a new page on Alto within CloudCannon, and ensuring it's shown in the correct place in your navigation bar.&nbsp;

Navigation in Alto is handled by front matter in Hugo, which can be easily edited in CloudCannon's Data Editor.

Each page has a 'Parent Section' property, which allows you to group related items in the sidebar.&nbsp;

You can also change the order of the page within the sidebar group using 'Weight'.
